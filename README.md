# What Is This?

This repo holds the data sheet for the hacktimeline (which can be found [here](https://hexadecim8.com/timeline.html/).

The hacktimeline is a curated project. As such, not every PR will be accepted.
The original idea for this project was to create a highly detailed and accurate timeline of events in "Hacking History"
for the purpose of coming to more accurate conclusions about the historic contours of our culture.

Before submitting a PR, please see the guidelines for submission!

# Guidelines

The hacktimeline is a curated project! not every PR will be accepted, so when you submit, please make sure the times, dates and references are as accurate as possible!

I will be double-checking submission content for accuracy!

## References

Most of the information on the hacktimeline comes from wikipedia, so this is a valid references source

Primary sources are always accepted

Reputable news sources are also valid secondary sources. Hopefully we won't have to provide a list of reputable secondary publications, but we will if we have to
