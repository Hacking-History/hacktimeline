1967,,,,,,,,,First known network breach,"The first known incidence of network penetration hacking took place when members of a computer club at a suburban Chicago area high school were provided access to IBM's APL network. In the Fall of 1967, IBM (through Science Research Associates) approached Evanston Township High School with the offer of four 2741 Selectric teletypewriter based terminals with dial-up modem connectivity to an experimental computer system which implemented an early version of the APL programming language. The APL network system was structured in Workspaces which were assigned to various clients using the system. Working independently, the students quickly learned the language and the system. They were free to explore the system, often using existing code available in public Workspaces as models for their own creations. Eventually, curiosity drove the students to explore the system's wider context. This first informal network penetration effort was later acknowledged as helping harden the security of one of the first publicly accessible networks:",https://i0.wp.com/evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ETHS-front-of-bldg.-WEB-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&ssl=1,,,https://i0.wp.com/evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ETHS-front-of-bldg.-WEB-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&ssl=1,,hack,#333333
